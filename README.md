# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

In this assignment, I created three seperate HTML documents for three different web pages, as well as a css document to further style the pages and adjust them to different sized screens.


# Contact-Info Page (contact.html)

The contact page contains a responsive nav bar, as well as a container for "Name", "Email", and "Message" input.  It also contains a "Submit" button.  Also has sticky footer.


# About-Me Page (index.html)

The About-Me page also has a responsive nav bar. The content of the page includes a contaier with an image of myself, a title, and two short paragraphs for the time being. Also has sticky footer.


# Portfolio (portfolio.html)

This page has a responsive nav bar.  It also contains two rows of 3 place holder cards per row with a place for an image, a title, and a short description paragraph per card. Also has sticky footer.


# Reflection

I ran into a few points that left me stumped for a while but for the most part I was able to figure everything out. There are however a few thigs I could not figure out that I will need to make a few adjustments on as I figure them out or learn how to do them properly. I did have fun having to create multiple pages at once that are all conected to each other. It was challenging and time consuming but also rewarding to have a responsive 3 page static web application to begin with that I made from scratch (well with the assistance of bootstrap too of course).
